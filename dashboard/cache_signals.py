Signal wiring for automatic cache invalidation across the public site.

Every model whose data appears on cached pages (CMS content, courts,
organizations, equipment, tournaments, reservations, and the organization
payment settings) is connected to ``invalidate_all_caches`` so that any
create/update/delete automatically refreshes cached pages, page data and
template fragments.
